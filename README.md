# destiny-slack-ghost
Slack app for getting Destiny stats.

Project is still in progress. Stay tuned for me details.

There are two options for testing: 

1. **Use your local machine.** Follow the guide here: http://www.girliemac.com/slack-httpstatuscats/ for more details.
2. **Using your own server.** More details to follow, but I finally figured this one out. The general idea is
    1. Run your app on a different port (6000)
    2. Configure your .htaccess file to include a subdirectory to be mapped to localhost:6000
